This test directory contains simple test programs and python for L1TCaloLayer1

The test programs are built using "scram b" in the test directory and they 
show up in the usual tmp area.  You may have to put it in your path by 
hand as cmsenv is not doing it :(

testUCTGeometry
	This is a simple geometry tester which tries out most combinations of calorimeter index and Layer-1 translations

testUCTLayer1
	This is program uses pseudo random numbers as input to test the emulator functionality

testL1TCaloLayer1.py
	This python is input to cmsRun to test the emulator.  It needs a file with FED raw data.
	It runs both the Layer-1 unpacker and the emulator to produce a file with CaloTowers.
