This test directory contains simple test programs and python for L1TCaloLayer1

The test programs are built using "make".  The Makefile included assumes that my old mkdep_makefile is in your home directory.
If you don't have it you can get it using:
   pushd $HOME
   wget http://www.hep.wisc.edu/~dasu/mkdep_makefile.tar.gz
   tar zxf mkdep_makefile.tar.gz
   popd
Note that make assumes that you built the CMSSW project using scram b as usual.

testUCTGeometry
	This is a simple geometry tester which tries out most combinations of calorimeter index and Layer-1 translations

testUCTLayer1
	This is program uses pseudo random numbers as input to test the emulator functionality

testL1TCaloLayer1.py
	This python is input to cmsRun to test the emulator.  It needs a file with FED raw data.
	It runs both the Layer-1 unpacker and the emulator to produce a file with CaloTowers.
